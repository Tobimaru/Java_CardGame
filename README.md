# Java_CardGame

A card game implemented in Java as a learning case. It's not meant to be state-of-the-art, just something to practice.

The project is managed as a multimodule Maven project. Compilation is supported for Java 21, and you have to use a Maven version that supports this Java version. This has been tested with Maven 3.9.6.
